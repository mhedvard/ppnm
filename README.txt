////////  Notes - Makefile ////////////////////////// 
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////
This section is most made as noted for myself, to remember how the code there is copyed multiple times works. 

/// Makefile /// 
To make the writing of the makefile faster I have used the following line multiple times, 
so that a large part of my makefile can be made by copy paste: 

mcs -target:exe $(addprefix -r:,$(filter %.dll,$^)) $(filter %.cs,$^)

here "$(addprefix -r:,$(filter %.dll,$^)) " adds the prefix -r in front of all the dll.files 
where $(filter %.dll,$^) filters out the dll files. 
In the same manner $(filter %.cs,$^) filter out the cs file. 
$^ referes to the prerequis (The listed files)
