The repository includes 3 folders: 
* Exercise 
* Homework 
* Exam

Each homework is divided into the folder A, B and C.
(For some of the homework part C is not made, so folder C does not exist for these.)

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////
////////  Notes - Makefile ////////////////////////// 
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////
This section is most made as noted for me, to remember how the code there is copied multiple times works. 

/// Makefile /// 
To make the writing of the makefile faster I have used the following line multiple times, 
so that a large part of my makefile can be made by copy paste: 

mcs -target:exe $(addprefix -r:,$(filter %.dll,$^)) $(filter %.cs,$^)

here "$(addprefix -r:,$(filter %.dll,$^)) " adds the prefix -r in front of all the dll. files 
where $(filter %.dll,$^) filters out the dll files. 
In the same manner $(filter %.cs,$^) filter out the cs file. 
$^ refers to the prerequis (The listed files)
